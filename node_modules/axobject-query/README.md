# AXObject Query

![CI](https://github.com/A11yance/axobject-query/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Approximate model of the [Chrome AXObject](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/accessibility/AXObject.h).

The project attempts to map the AXObject concepts to the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Roles Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles) so that a complete representation of the semantic HTML layer, as it is exposed assistive technology, can be obtained.
